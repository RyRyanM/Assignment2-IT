		<h4>What's It Like to Work in IT? The Scoop from IT Pros</h4>
		<a href="https://www.comptia.org/career-change/why-change/it-pros-career-insights">https://www.comptia.org/career-change/why-change/it-pros-career-insights</a>
		<p><b>This web source displays the results from interviewing 3 different IT professionals to gain some insight on what it's like to work in IT.</b><br>
			<b>Bonnie Brennan</b>- Angular Architect and Google Developer. She focuses on JavaScript development and architecture, with a focus on Angular and enterprise. She says that she became an expert through working with other developers, as a junior developer she was able to self-teach most of it, however, as a senior developer she stated that “there’s only so much you can learn on your own. I think it’s essential for senior developers to get involved in the community and learn from each other.” Her typical day at work as she has said is: “I work remotely, so I get up in the morning and go to my home office. I sit here and write code most of the day. I collaborate with other developers and do video chats. Most of the time I just sit here and write code.” The challenging aspect of her position: “Coding is hard to explain to someone unless they've gone through the process of using it and problem solved using it. When you're learning to code, you have to make mistakes so you're better at anticipating problems in the future.” Many mistakes are made in order to gain experience and be better prepared and grow in adapting to future situations.<br>
			<b>Wendell Thacker</b>- He is a network engineer who is currently working as technical support, help desk support and network engineering at a small company as at larger companies, he says that everything is sectioned off and as such there isn’t as much variety in their tasks. He is completing help desk tasks, like helping people reset passwords, and managing servers and setting up virtual machines. When working with other IT professionals, there is a running joke that people think that just because they are an IT professional, they can do anything. He says people can sometimes expect him to know how to use Photoshop, which he doesn’t as he is in network engineering and tech support. He says some necessary skills are, listening skills, communication skills, the ability to hold a conversation, and the ability to work well with all kinds of people. In his job, he is often working with and helping people, so it's better if you can build a rapport with them.<br>
			<b>Ezequiel Pitty</b>- Vice President of Infrastructure Engineering Core Services
What he does: “I work mainly on server deployments and infrastructure management. In general, I provide maintenance and support to business applications.” He says that the skills needed for this role are: Independence, flexibility, the ability to be self-adaptive, the ability to work well under little or no supervision. Many of these skills suggest independence, it is unclear on whether he works with other IT professionals in his field of work. His typical day at work: “I configure scripts to perform server maintenance and functioning and load balancers and database deployments.” And how he spends most of his time: “My work life is between 40 to 60 hours per week, and I spend plenty of time with my wife and kids. I also take time off for vacation at least once or twice a year. My work–life balance is great.” Ezequiel does not mention any challenging aspects that he faces in his position, however, he does state that the personality that are a good fit for his position are: “Thinkers, people who use common sense and are able to react quickly to solve problems.” Potentially, if one does not fit this personality type, they could perhaps find difficulty in this position.</p>
